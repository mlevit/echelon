# Artefact

An artefact is object that contains data i.e., source file, transient table, hub, link, satellite, fact or dimension table. Artifacts are used to describe the data that is being processed.

| type   | dimension_type_0_table           | The type 0 dimension attributes never change and are assigned to attributes that have durable values or are described as 'Original'.                                                                      |
| type   | dimension_type_1_table           | The type 1 dimension method overwrites old with new data, and therefore does not track historical data.                                                                                                   |
| type   | dimension_type_2_table           | The type 2 dimension method tracks historical data by creating multiple records for a given natural key in the dimensional tables with separate surrogate keys and/or different version numbers.          |
| type   | fixed_width_file                 | In a fixed-width text file, data is contained in columns that are of a fixed width (meaning that each column contains a certain number of character positions).                                           |

| type   | snapshot_fact_table              | The periodic snapshot, as the name implies, takes a "picture of the moment", where the moment could be any defined period of time, e.g. a performance summary of a salesman over the previous month.      |
