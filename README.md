# What is Echelon?

Echelon is a flexible and scalable run and governance framework. It gathers technical, operational, and business metadata and puts it all in one central database. This setup allows Echelon to be used in various ways, like creating workflows based on metadata, keeping an eye on data quality, mapping out where data comes from, and more.

## What are the various components that make up Echelon?

Echelon is a comprehensive ecosystem built upon four essential components, each contributing uniquely to its functionality and utility:

- **Database**: At the core of Echelon lies a robust and centralised database. This repository serves as the heart of the framework, meticulously collecting and organizing a wealth of technical, operational, and business metadata. Through this database, Echelon gains the capacity to holistically manage and present crucial information that forms the backbone of various data-related activities.

- **CLI / API**: Echelon's Command Line Interface (CLI) and Application Programming Interface (API) together offer a gateway to its capabilities. The CLI empowers users to interact with the framework through a command-line interface, providing a streamlined and efficient way to execute tasks, fetch data, and manage metadata-related operations. Simultaneously, the API grants developers the flexibility to integrate Echelon's functionalities seamlessly into their own applications, fostering interoperability and expanding its potential use cases.

- **Web**: The Echelon Web component manifests as a dynamic and user-friendly web-based application. Tailored to cater to a diverse audience, this interactive interface provides an intuitive means to visualize and explore the wealth of information stored within the Echelon ecosystem. Its role extends beyond mere visualization, allowing users to engage with operational workflows, assess data assets, and delve into the details of data lineage and governance, all while maintaining a responsive and engaging user experience.

- **Documentation**: Recognising the significance of clear guidance and accessibility, Echelon places emphasis on comprehensive documentation. This component encapsulates valuable insights, guidelines, tutorials, and best practices, ensuring that users, administrators, and developers alike can harness the framework's potential to the fullest. The documentation not only aids in getting started with Echelon but also serves as an ongoing reference, promoting efficient utilisation and encouraging the exploration of its diverse capabilities.
